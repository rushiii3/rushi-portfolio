Web security is an ever-evolving landscape, and as a developer, it’s critical to understand the most common vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. The **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** publishes a list of the **10 most critical security risks** facing web applications. 

This guide provides a **detailed breakdown** of each risk, how they are exploited, and **best practices** to mitigate them.

---

## 1. Broken Access Control 🔓
### What it is:
Access control ensures that users can only perform actions within their allowed permissions. Broken access control occurs when restrictions are not properly enforced, allowing attackers to access unauthorized data, modify records, or perform actions as other users.

### How it’s exploited:
- **Forced Browsing:** Attackers manually navigate to restricted pages by guessing URLs.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user exploits misconfigurations to gain admin-level access.
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References):** Attackers change object IDs in API requests to access other users' data.

### How to prevent it:
✅ Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).  
✅ Use **server-side authorization** checks for every request.  
✅ Enforce **least privilege** and **deny by default** policies.  
✅ Conduct **regular penetration testing** to identify access control weaknesses.

---

## 2. Cryptographic Failures 🔐
### What it is:
Cryptographic failures (previously known as **Sensitive Data Exposure**) occur when sensitive data is not adequately protected, leading to data theft, integrity violations, or unauthorized access.

### How it’s exploited:
- **Using weak encryption algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1)** allows attackers to crack hashed passwords.
- **Lack of encryption for data in transit** makes it easy for attackers to intercept communications (e.g., MITM attacks).
- **Hardcoded API keys and credentials** in source code expose sensitive data in repositories.

### How to prevent it:
✅ Use strong encryption standards (AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit).  
✅ Store passwords securely using **bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2**.  
✅ Never **hardcode secrets**—use **environment variables** or **secret management tools** (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).

---

## 3. Injection Attacks 🏹
### What it is:
Injection attacks occur when untrusted data is sent as part of a command or query, allowing attackers to execute unintended actions.

### Common types:
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Attackers manipulate SQL queries to access or modify databases.
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts are injected into web pages, affecting users.
- **Command Injection:** Attackers execute arbitrary system commands through improperly handled inputs.

### How it’s exploited:
- **Unsanitized user inputs** are directly used in database queries.
- **Dynamic SQL statements** concatenate user inputs, making them vulnerable.
- **Lack of input validation** allows attackers to inject scripts or commands.

### How to prevent it:
✅ Use **prepared statements** and **parameterized queries** for database access.  
✅ Sanitize and validate **all** user inputs.  
✅ Implement **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to mitigate XSS attacks.  
✅ Use a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to detect and block malicious requests.

## 4. Insecure Design 🏗️
### What it is:
Insecure design refers to weaknesses in the system’s architecture that leave it vulnerable to attacks.

### How it’s exploited:
- **Lack of threat modeling** results in security oversights during design.
- **Insufficient validation of user actions** leads to logical vulnerabilities.
- **Missing security layers** in APIs make them easy to exploit.

### How to prevent it:
✅ Integrate **security by design** principles into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
✅ Conduct **threat modeling** to identify potential risks early.  
✅ Implement **security design patterns** such as input validation, authentication controls, and encryption.

---

## 5. Security Misconfiguration ⚠️
### What it is:
Security misconfigurations occur when systems are set up with insecure defaults or missing security hardening.

### How it’s exploited:
- **Default credentials (e.g., admin/admin)** allow easy access for attackers.
- **Verbose error messages** expose sensitive system details.
- **Unrestricted CORS settings** allow cross-origin attacks.

### How to prevent it:
✅ Remove **default accounts and credentials**.  
✅ Disable **unnecessary services, endpoints, and permissions**.  
✅ Regularly update software and apply security patches.  
✅ Enforce **secure headers** (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options).

---

## 6. Vulnerable & Outdated Components 🛠️
### What it is:
Using outdated or vulnerable dependencies exposes applications to well-known exploits.

### How to prevent it:
✅ Use **dependency management tools** (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, npm audit).  
✅ Regularly update third-party libraries and frameworks.  
✅ Monitor for **zero-day vulnerabilities** and apply patches ASAP.

---

## 7. Identification & Authentication Failures 🆔
### How to prevent it:
✅ Implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for added security.  
✅ Enforce **strong password policies** and secure session handling.

---

## 8. Software & Data Integrity Failures 📝
### How to prevent it:
✅ Use **digital signatures** to verify the integrity of software updates.  
✅ Secure **CI/CD pipelines** and restrict access to deployments.

---

## 9. Security Logging & Monitoring Failures 📊
### How to prevent it:
✅ Implement **centralized logging** and **real-time alerts** for suspicious activities.

---

## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) 🎯
### How to prevent it:
✅ Validate and sanitize **all** user-supplied URLs.  
✅ Restrict **outbound network requests** with allowlists.

---

## Conclusion 💡
By understanding the **OWASP Top 10**, developers can proactively secure applications against modern threats. Security is not a one-time task—stay informed, apply best practices, and continuously test your applications.

🔐 **Stay secure, stay ahead!** 🚀
